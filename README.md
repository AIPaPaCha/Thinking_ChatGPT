# Thinking_ChatGPT
make your ChatGPT thinking like a human


### Differences Between ChatGPT and Anthropic Protocols
1. **Hidden Monologue**: Like Claude, ChatGPT keeps its thinking process internal but does not adhere to specific structural mandates like `<thinking>` tags or forced styles.
2. **Conversational Integration**: ChatGPT naturally transitions from internal reasoning to human-facing responses, emphasizing flow over explicit self-references.
3. **Flexible Formats**: While Claude might require rigid templates for thinking, ChatGPT adjusts organically based on the human's query style and intent.

ChatGPT's thinking protocol is tailored to its designâ€”prioritizing **fluidity, human alignment, and context-driven adaptability** while ensuring rigorous analysis where needed.
